    "report": "A series of T1- and T2-weighted MR tomograms in three planes visualized sub- and supratentorial\nstructures.\nThe midline structures are not displaced.\nIn series of IV contrasting in the right frontal and parietal lobes, single focal masses of round shape\nwith diffuse type of contrast accumulation were noted and isointense MR-signal, the sizes were\n0.6x0.7 cm and 0.54x0.54 cm, respectively. Against the background of these focal formations defined\nzone of vasogenic edema in the right hemisphere, spreading in the frontal and parietal lobes, with an\napproximate extent of 4.4x9.1x4.2 cm, with an indistinctly expressed mass effect in the form of\ndeformation of the upper contour of the right lateral ventricular body.\nIn the parasagittal sections of the left frontal lobe and left hemisphere of the cerebellum there are\nsingle small foci with weak diffuse type of contrast accumulation /visualized on one slice/.\nIn DWI mode no diffusion disturbance areas were detected.\nIn the white matter of the frontal and left parietal lobes, subcortically and paraventricularly,\nmultiple foci of gliosis /hyperintense on T2, T2-flair, isointense on T1/ without perifocal infiltration,\nranging in size from 0.3 cm to 0.9 cm are detected.\nLateral ventricles are almost symmetrical, not dilated, dimensions within the age normometry,\nnormal configuration. The 3rd ventricle is not dilated. The IVth ventricle is not dilated, not deformed.\nNo additional formations in the area of the cerebellopontine corners were revealed. Internal\nauditory canals are not dilated.\nOrbits without peculiarities, data for the presence of obvious pathologic structural changes,\nreliably detected foci of pathologic MR-signal changes in their projection were not revealed. There\nis no visualization of crystalline lens /susp. postoperative changes/.\nThe chiasmal area is featureless, the pituitary gland is not enlarged in size, the pituitary tissue has\na normal signal. The chiasmal cistern is not changed. The funnel of the pituitary gland is not displaced.\nBasal cisterns are not dilated, not deformed.\nSubarachnoid convexital spaces and sulci are not dilated. Lateral slits of the brain are symmetrical,\nnot dilated.\nThe cerebellar tonsils are located at the level of the greater occipital foramen.\nCraniovertebral junction - without pathology.\nPneumatization of the facial sinuses is not significantly disturbed.",
    "conclusion": "Single /2/ focal masses in the right frontal and parietal lobes with a zone of perifocal vasogenic\nedema, single /2/ contrast-positive foci in the left frontal lobe and left cerebellar hemisphere /probably\nmts/.\nNumerous supratentorial foci of gliosis (vascular in nature).",
